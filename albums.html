					<div><img src="images/album_big1.jpg" id="x1" class="fader1" alt="united" style="margin-top:-55px;" /><P id="review" >Summer is a thing that only comes once a year, but when it is here it can be the best thing ever. For some it means 3 months of limited responsibility and maximized relaxation, highlighted with common things such as hanging out with friends or doing whatever. The point is it takes a band with talent to truly capture a mood or season and put it on a full length. For their debut, French foursome Phoenix have done just that, created an album rich with songs that give off vibes similar to dancing in the summer sun or just watching the sun set in the cool but warm air (cheesy? yeah but the music isn't). To put it simply: the drummer doesn't have a pulse but this work is very much alive.<br/><strong>&#126; Zachary Powell (Sputnik Music | February 18th, 2007)</strong></P></div>
					
					
					<div><img src="images/album_big2.jpg" id="x1" class="fader1" alt="united" style="margin-top:-55px;" /><P id="review">On Alphabetical, Phoenix sounds more easygoing, but no less fastidious. "Everything Is Everything" comes gleaming out of the gate with a mix of bright guitar chords, tingling cymbal accents, and lispy vocals that sound at home in the verse as in the chorus. "Run Run Run" makes the more aerobically charged Air link explicit with a simple acoustic-figure tumbled through in waltz-time. Steely Dan allusions show up in "If It's Not With You," which lays doo-wop backing vocals over a warm electric-piano patch. <br/><strong>&#126; Andy Battaglia (AV Club | July 26, 2004)</strong></p>

It doesn't beg or shout for your attention. It's brilliant spring listening at its best. The melodies are contemporary and not though it's obvious that Phoenix has tried to loosen up, they're still as intricate as ever. The levels are just right, and there's absolutely not a single wasted note, chord or lyric. It's this amazing economy with music that has Phoenix at its very best. You can just picture them playing for the lazy, beach boy hipsters on a cool, sunny afternoon at the beach.<br/><strong>&#126; Arjun (Sputnik Music | March 1st, 2007)</strong></p>

					<div><img src="images/album_big4.jpg" id="x1" class="fader1" alt="united" style="margin-top:-55px;" /><P id="review">These arch Frenchmen make precision-tooled pop that somehow retains a sense of urgency and playfulness -- an impressive balancing act consistently slam-dunked by effortlessly ingratiating choruses. Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (what an effing title!) opens with two near-perfect prototypes, the gloriously sunny "Listzomania," and its crisper, quicker cousin, "1901." Nothing quite matches that salvo, but the atmospheric, Air-indebted "Fences" and yacht-rockin' "Girlfriend" come close. There's even an epic, mid-album palate cleanser (genial comedown "Love Like a Sunset") that counteracts any potential bliss overdose.<br/><strong>&#126;  Josh Modell (SPIN | May 11 2009, 5:07 PM ET)</strong></p>
